With that code you will be able to control ShellRacing cars from ESP32. Currently
the direction is controlled by pulling the defined pins to ground, but using ESP32
you can put sensors like accelerometers,gyros,joysticks whatever you like
## What works?
```
Controlling the car in all directions including combinations like up+left
Robust connection and scanning
```

Getting the battery status
